# Gamer Fun League (GFL)

Work in progress!

The idea for Gamer Fun League (GFL) is to have a fun Overwatch League manager tool. Users can sign up and create a team. Teams can then add players, find scrims, and enter weekly games.

### Setup

First run:

```
npm install
```

Then create default.json in the config folder. Make sure you change the parameters.
